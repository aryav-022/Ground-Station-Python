# Ground-Station-Python
This is just an ilustratrion of the ground station for launching satellites. I made this as an entrance level task for a college soceity.

To run this code in your device, you need to download the zip file of this code and python 3.10 or above should be installed on your pc. Maybe even lower versions of python might work but i did it on 3.10.

In your windows power shell, enter the command **```pip install opencv-python```** to install cv2 module.
Recheck and ensure both sattelite-dish.ico and main.py file are in the same sub-directory.

If the code still gives an error regarding bitmap or anything related to icon, you may need to comment out line number 274 in this code.
